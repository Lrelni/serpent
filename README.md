# Serpent Music Practice Tool
This program was written in Python using wxPython and pyAudio.
As of now only Linux and Windows are supported with binaries. There is no plan to support macOS.
The source files are included, so if all libraries are installed, you could run
Serpent on most platforms.

Currently, the tool includes a backing track. It acts as a better metronome and tuning tool all in one.
